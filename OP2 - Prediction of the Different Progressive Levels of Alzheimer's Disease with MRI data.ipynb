    "\n",
    "- This is an optional model development project on a real dataset related to predicting the different progressive levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The students are expected to use tensorflow library for modeling process and will be asked to submit predicted labels for a test dataset by which their score will be evaluated objectively.\n",
    "- This project is included in the **UpSchool - Google Developers Machine Learning - Deep Learning Program**.\n",
    "- In this project, you are supposed to provide a data science model to determine the level of Alzheimer disease. The levels are the ordinal categories from lower to higher respectively: 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 (that are the progressive levels of Alzheimer's disease)\n",

Subjects who report all first-degree family members as having a family history absent of cognitive impairment/psychiatric condition (primary neurological problem/psychiatric condition coded as 2–8) or a primary neurological problem/psychiatric condition is reported (coded as 1), but a code other than those listed below is reported, will have naccfam = 0.<br>For subjects with Form A3 data from multiple form versions, all available data will be included in the calculation of naccfam.

If some first-degree family members are coded as No and some are coded as Unknown, then they are all coded as Unknown (naccfam = 9).<br>In general, a known history of cognitive impairment reported at any visit supersedes all visits with missing codes. Likewise, an indication of cognitive impairment at any visit supersedes all other visits where a history of cognitive impairment is indicated as not present. In all other conditions where reporting varies, data from the most recent visit are used to calculate naccfam.<br>If Form A3 was never submitted for any version of the UDS, naccfam will take a value of -4.

NACC has created a new derived variable for Total GDS score so that subjects who were given the GDS in the earlier versions of UDS v1 will have a total GDS score if they skipped three or fewer items on the questionnaire. If the subject was missing more than three of the 15 items on the GDS for any UDS version, naccgds = 88. The UDS Coding Guidebook for Form B6 provides the algorithm for calculating the GDS score when three or fewer items are missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
